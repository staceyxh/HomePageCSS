Notes for our project.

We used a transform on the links in the nav bar so they grow slightly when you hover over them
We used a transition on the image of the person's face to make it grow when hovered over. Give one to the narcissists in the room.
We used color to distiguish between reading, lab, and prep assignments, as well as between current, past, or the next day.
We used a different font and boldness for the assignment label to make it stick out more compared to the assignment.
We changed the display of elements in the my account form to block so that it would lay out more nicely.
